# Dumb Chess AI ü§ñ‚ôüÔ∏è

A "not-so-smart" chess AI that plays ~~okayish~~ moves. Perfect for learning how chess AIs work (or how they *don't* work).

---

## Features ‚ú®
- **Basic Chess Rules**: It knows how pieces move (mostly).
- **MCTS "Strategy"**: Simulates 1000 random moves to find ~~good~~ *not illegal* plays
- **MCTS**: Uses random simulations to guess good moves (spoiler: it‚Äôs not Stockfish).
- **Training Data Generation**: Exports game states to train slightly less dumb AIs later.

# Dumb Chess AI: Guaranteed to Disappoint ‚ôüÔ∏èü§ñ

A "barely functional" chess bot that combines MCTS with pure chaos. Perfect for losing games spectacularly.
